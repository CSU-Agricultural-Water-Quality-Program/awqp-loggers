# Cercospora Temp RH Sensor
 AWQP project focused on the development of low-cost temperature and relative
 humidity sensors to be deployed in sugarbeet fields to help inform crop
 susceptibility to Cercospora fungus.

 Includes code for Particle Boron to take temp. and RH% readings via SHT31
 sensor every 60 minutes with sleep between readings. Data streamed to Ubidots
 via webhook in particle product group.
